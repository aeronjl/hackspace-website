			<p class="font-semibold">We want more exploratory scientific and technological work to happen in the UK.</p>
            
            <p>However, the

			We’re building a space for technical work in Central London that

		<p class="font-semibold my-2">The new workspace will give the most-exceptional young scientists/technologists:</p>
		<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
			<li>
				Access to a peer group; which raises ambition, provides examples of good taste, encourages,
				and has high expectations.
			</li>
			<li>
				A set of values; pro-technology, pro-progress, optimism, curiosity, non-conformity,
				ambitiousness.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tools; for laboratory science and manufacturing outside institutional constraints (e.g.
				university IP-constraints and the permission of supervisors)
			</li>
			<li>Access to private knowledge; of the frontier of fields and new opportunities.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			We will judge our success on whether the workspaces’ members have more ideas, enter new
			collaborations, and start companies around their work that they otherwise wouldn’t have.
